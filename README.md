# NS-SD-RAN

This project is proposed to scale O-RAN UE's simulation facility and eradicate RANSIM limitations. Aim of the project is to integrate SD-RAN with ns-3 simulation modules instead of RANSIM. NS-3 provides variety of easy customizations and scaling. NS-SD-RAN is more computation friendly as compared to RANSIM.
